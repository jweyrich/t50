Legend:
+ Added feature

! Known issue / missing feature

T50 5.5 - March 1, 2014
 * Code compiles fine with LLVM clang 3.x;
 * SSE is enabled by default in x86-64 architecture (commented on Makefile);
 * Changed return type of module funcions;
 * Small corrections on modules functions;
 * All files were converted to UNIX text format;
 - gre_encapsulation() was still not used on ospf.c;
 - Calls to sendto with second parameter wrong;
 * Function ip_header() added to modules/ip.c.
 - On embeded systems the use of VLAs on modules functions can be hazardous
    due to restricted stack space. "Differential" buffer reallocation on heap fix this problem.
 * cksum() 5 times faster now.
 * Using a trick to deal with pointers of multiple types on modules functions.
 * New Makefile.
 * Minor fix on getOrdinalSuffix() function, no t50.c (11, 12 & 13 have a "th" suffix!).
 + Added comments with FIX, FIXME, NOTE prefix for better code reading.
 * Changed the way modules table are declared. See modules.c for advice.
 * Module table are not order dependant anymore!
 * Created src/help directory and src/include/help.h header to improve module modularity.

T50 5.3 - April 9, 2011
 + New License: it is, finally, licensed under GPL v2.0. Please, refer
 to LICENSE document for further information.
